# NopGenesForMaize
An undergraduate research project to determine the gene model for Nop1 and Nop2 from B73v5 Zea mays

The main file here is going to be the Jupyter Lab notebook that describes the process. My code was written to work on my specific computer, so file paths would need to be changed if you used this code.

I am using binder to let people see the notebook:
